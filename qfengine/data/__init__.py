Quantitative Finance Database
-----------------------------


When we talk about data, there are a couple of things that are analagous in all contexts:

What "type of data" is it?

    This forces us to define the broadest of context:
        ---| Data that are useful for Quantitative Finance "purpose(s)" |----

    Hence, regardless of where we get it:
        - Locally
        - API
        - Web Scraping
    
    where the data can be:
        - Historical (time-series)
        - Live (latest)
    
    they all boil down to:
        - Reference Data (Companies, Data Vendors, Securities, Exchanges)
        - Price Data (of assets)
        - Fundamental Data (income statement, cash flow, balance sheet)
        - Alternative Data (etc...)
